 # Introduction

Welcome to the EmbeddedFPSExample tutorial!
This tutorial teaches how to create an authoritative multiplayer first person shooter game with Unity and [Darkrift 2](https://darkriftnetworking.com/DarkRift2).
This tutorial will cover the following subjects:
- Multiplayer game project architecture
- Darkrift 2 basics.
- Choosing between an embedded and a standalone Darkrift server.
- Basic room management
- Client prediction, reconciliation, interpolation, authoritative movement.
- Lag compensation (shooting in an FPS game)

Note that this is a basic tutorial so a lot of networking systems will be present in a simplified or inefficient way. You can find the entire source of the client and the server on [Github](https://github.com/LukeStampfli/EmbeddedFPSExample)
